# SimpleAutoTools Configuration (Tag-Based Version)
# Plugin by NguyenDevs
#
# WHAT'S NEW:
# - No longer requires tool-blocks.yml!
# - Uses Minecraft's built-in Tag API for block detection
# - Automatically supports all current and future blocks
# - More accurate and maintainable

# Enabled worlds - Plugin will only work in these worlds
# Leave empty to enable in all worlds
enabled-worlds:
  - world
  - world_nether
  - world_the_end

# Tool selection priority
priority:
  # Priority order - Tools will be compared in this order
  # Available options: ENCHANTMENT, MATERIAL, DURABILITY
  # First item has highest priority
  order:
    - ENCHANTMENT
    - MATERIAL
    - DURABILITY

  # Material tier priority (NETHERITE > DIAMOND > IRON > GOLDEN > STONE > WOOD)
  material:
    enabled: true
    # Check if tool can harvest the block (uses Minecraft's harvest level tags)
    # Example: Wooden pickaxe can't mine diamond ore, golden pickaxe can't mine obsidian
    check-harvest-level: true

  # Durability priority
  # HIGH = use high durability tools first (preserve low durability tools)
  # LOW = use low durability tools first (save best tools for later)
  # NONE = ignore durability when selecting tools
  durability: HIGH

# Search locations for tools
search-locations:
  hotbar: true      # Search in hotbar (slots 0-8)
  inventory: true   # Search in main inventory (slots 9-35)

# Features
features:
  auto-switch-blocks: true    # Auto-switch tools when mining blocks
  auto-switch-entities: true  # Auto-switch weapons when attacking entities

# Advanced: Smart enchantment selection (NEW!)
# When enabled, this acts as a TIEBREAKER when tools have equal priority
# Example: You have 2 pickaxes with same enchants and levels
#   - Mining glass: Will prefer the one with Silk Touch
#   - Mining diamond ore: Will prefer the one with Fortune
# This does NOT override your priority.yml settings!
# Disable if you want pure priority.yml control
smart-enchantment-selection: true
